If you need an alarm clock, you may need an\\n\\nearlier bedtime.  \n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Avoid sleeping in—even on weekends. The more your weekend/weekday sleep schedules\\n\\ndiffer, the worse the jetlag-like symptoms you'll experience. If you need to make up for a\\n\\nlate night, opt for a daytime nap rather than sleeping in. This allows you to pay off your\\n\\nsleep debt without disturbing your natural sleep-wake rhythm.  \n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Be smart about napping.

Among lots of other health benefits, eating a\\n\\nbalanced breakfast can help sync up your biological clock by letting your body know that\\n\\nit’s time to wake up and get going. Skipping breakfast on the other hand, can delay your\\n\\nblood sugar rhythms, lower your energy, and increase your stress, factors that may\\n\\ndisrupt sleep.\\n\nFight after-dinner drowsiness. If you get sleepy way before your bedtime, get off the\\n\\ncouch and do something mildly stimulating, such as washing the dishes, calling a friend, or\\n\\ngetting clothes ready for the next day. If you give in to the drowsiness, you may wake up\\n\\nlater in the night and have trouble getting back to sleep.  \n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\n\\nTip 2: Control your exposure to light\\nMelatonin is a naturally occurring hormone controlled by light exposure that helps regulate\\n\\nyour sleep-wake cycle. Your brain secretes more melatonin when it's dark—making you\\n\\nsleepy—and less when it's light—making you more alert.

This isn't a problem if you're exercising in the morning or\\n\\nafternoon, but too close to bed and it can interfere with sleep.  \n27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Try to finish moderate to vigorous workouts at least three hours before bedtime.

Keep the lights\\n\\ndim and avoid screens so as not to cue your body that it's time to wake up.  \n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Postpone worrying and brainstorming.

Similarly, if a great idea is keeping you awake, make a\\n\\nnote of it on paper and fall back to sleep knowing you'll be much more productive after a\\n\\ngood night's rest.  \n59  \\n\\nMore Information\\n\nReferences\\n\\n 1.
